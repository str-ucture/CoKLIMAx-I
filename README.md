# CoKLIMAx I: Microclimate Analysis and Visualization Toolkit

Welcome to the **CoKLIMAx I** toolkit! This project provides a comprehensive set of scripts and notebooks for processing, analyzing, and visualizing high-resolution microclimate simulation data.

---

## About the Project

Our focus is on extracting valuable insights from detailed microclimate simulations performed using **PALM-4U (PALM Model System for Urban Applications)**. PALM-4U is a powerful 3D atmospheric model designed to simulate urban environments. It accounts for complex urban features like buildings, vegetation, and intricate atmospheric processes, making it an invaluable tool for:

- **Urban Climate Research:** Understanding phenomena like urban heat islands and wind patterns.
- **Climate Adaptation Strategies:** Evaluating and informing planning decisions for more resilient urban spaces.

The output from these simulations, in netCDF4 format, is efficiently handled and explored through the documented resources within this repository. PALM-4U is an open-source model continuously developed by a consortium of institutions, notably under the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)'s "[UC¬≤] - Urban Climate Under Change" program.
